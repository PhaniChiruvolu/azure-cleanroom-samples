# Confidential access of protected data through an API endpoint

This demo uses the default `nginx-hello` application to bring up an API endpoint for servicing network calls.

Network protection policy is associated with the endpoint that determines the allowed API calls. The sample flows package this policy into an OCI artefact and push it into an Azure Container Registry

The sample flows invoke the API endpoint after the clean room has been deployed, displaying response from both allowed and disallowed calls.
